# House Price Prediction with PCA: Simplified README

This repository showcases a House Price Prediction project that utilizes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature reduction, streamlining a dataset of 143 features down to a more manageable 40 features. Various machine learning models, including Random Forest, Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), XGBoost, and Decision Tree, are implemented for accurate predictions.

## Dataset
The project centers around the Ames Housing Dataset, narrowing down its 143 features to 40 features that hold significant predictive power, such as LotArea, OverallQual, and YearBuilt.

## Dimensionality Reduction
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed to address high dimensionality and enhance model efficiency. It reduces the original feature set to 40 principal components while retaining essential information.

## Models
Multiple machine learning models are explored to predict house prices including:
- Random Forest
- Linear Regression
- SVR
- XGBoost
- Decision Tree
